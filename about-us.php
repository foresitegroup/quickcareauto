Do you remember when you and your dad drove to the local auto shop to have a mechanic look under your car hood?  You knew the mechanic's name and he knew what was under your hood.<br>

Many companies are now nationwide.  QCA is following the growing trend of the "local" movement.  Many consumers want to support local products, businesses and the like.  Step into the historic building and you can see the era of the good old days, when American embraced the auto.  Though the emphasis is on quick, you might want to just sit back and relax.<br>
<br>

As you step into the building you will see an updated interior.  You'll enjoy the timeless car advertisements and signs featured in the lounge area.  Classic mid-century furnishings invite you to sit while waiting for your car to be serviced.  You couldn't find service stations in your childhood days with wireless internet access, but can at Quick Care Auto.

  <strong>Martin Leaity</strong> was born in the south of England and has been crazy about cars from day one. He earned his allowance each week washing his Dad's car and enjoyed helping out neighbors with theirs as well. He emigrated with his family to the U.S and enlisted in the U.S. Navy, serving for 5 years during and after Operation Desert Storm. After the service, he focused on one of his other interests &mdash; books. Martin managed bookstores for 15 years and when he wasn't working, he was working on keeping his and his friend's cars looking their best. Martin joined Quick Care Auto in June 2010 and is back doing what he loves best &mdash; making customer's cars look their best. He lives with his wife in Cedarburg and enjoys working on his house and cars, going to car shows, car races, and collecting old car models and books.
