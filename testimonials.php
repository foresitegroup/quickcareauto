"Recently I have had two of my vehicles serviced at Quick Care Auto and found them to be very competent, honest and competitively priced.  I like the fact that  I could personally view the defects prior to them starting the work and that they completed the repairs on time for the price quoted or below.  I have recommended them to two people and they both gave me positive feedback as well."  - Ken<br>

"Quick Care Auto did a fantastic job fixing my car. The staff was really friendly and kept me in the loop for what ended up being a rather big job on my car.   I never felt like I was being taken advantage of; the mechanics there really know there stuff and do a wonderful job!  I would and will recommend to anyone who needs anything from an oil change to a new alternator!  I am very grateful to the mechanics that made me not hate my car anymore!"  - Maggie
